The main goal of my model would be to categorize people by likely to pay credit card bill and not likely to pay. The four main features of this model is groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. A high amount of money spent on dining out and entertainment but low amount on groceries and utilities would pose someone who may not pay their bills on time and vise versa for people who are likely. Combining the dining out/entertainment features with the grocery/utility features can help us in the model to identify the differences. We would have to watch for people who spend alot on everything and people who dont spend alot. This may mean that they are and aren't likely to pay their bill respectivly. Depending on the amount of data, the number of neighbours would vary.
